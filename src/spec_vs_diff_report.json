  "summary": "Diff adds a Motoko backend actor with signup/admin APIs and a React frontend with routes, auth guards, admin list/detail pages, and a themed layout. However, stable persistence for signups and the required generated brand images are not evidenced, and student “view submitted profile” UI is not confirmable from the provided diff summary. Several extra features (user profile setup, caffeine referral footer, secret-token-based access control init) appear beyond the BuildRequest.",
